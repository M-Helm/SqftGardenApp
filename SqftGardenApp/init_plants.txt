Within these varieties, several different cultivars have emerged. The cucumber is originally from Southern Asia, but now grows on most continents. Many different varieties are traded on the global market.\n\nThe cucumber is a creeping vine that roots in the ground and grows up trellises or other supporting frames, wrapping around supports with thin, spiraling tendrils. The plant has large leaves that form a canopy over the fruit. The fruit of the cucumber is roughly cylindrical, elongated with tapered ends, and may be as large as 60 centimeters (24 in) long and 10 centimeters (3.9 in) in diameter.[Source: Wikipedia]", "scientific_name": "Cucumis sativus", "photo": "photo_cucumber_512px.jpg", "yield": "6 lbs", "zone": "-1", "iso_icon": "iso_generic_256px.png"},
